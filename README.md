## What is Segment?

Segment is a comprehensive software package for medical image analysis.
Segment is developed with cardiovascular MRI (CMR) in mind, but it has also been validated using Cardiac CT and Myocardial Perfusion SPECT. The software package can also be used for a wide range of Radiology and Cardiology applications.

## What is the Segment Source Distribution?

The Segment source code is regularly exported from Medviso for free use by the academic research community, through the collaboration between Medviso AB and the Cardiac MR Group at Lund University, Sweden.
This forms the basis for segment-open, the Segment Source Distribution, which can be found in this repository.

Note that not all functionality in Segment is present in the Source Distribution, and the Source Distribution is neither FDA-approved nor CE-marked, and may not be used for clinical purposes.
Some parts of the code is protected (Matlab p-files).

## Terms of use

Segment is **freely available for academic research** in source and [binary](http://medviso.com/download2/) form, provided that you cite relevant publications and the usage of the software in your publications (see specific papers below).

The Segment Source Distribution may not be used for commercial or clinical applications.
