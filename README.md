## What is Segment?

Segment is a comprehensive software package for medical image analysis, [widely used in research](http://medviso.com/research/publication/).

Segment is developed with cardiovascular MRI (CMR) in mind, but it has also been validated using Cardiac CT and Myocardial Perfusion SPECT. The software package can also be used for a wide range of Radiology and Cardiology applications.


## What is the Segment Source Distribution?

The Segment source code is regularly exported from Medviso for free use by the academic research community, through the collaboration between Medviso AB and the Cardiac MR Group at Lund University, Sweden.
This forms the basis for segment-open, the Segment Source Distribution, which can be found in this repository.

Note that not all functionality in Segment is present in the Source Distribution, and the Source Distribution is neither FDA-approved nor CE-marked, and may not be used for clinical purposes.
Some parts of the code is protected (Matlab p-files).

## How do I use Segment?

 * Have a look in the folder [source/Docs](source/Docs)
 * The [user manual](source/Docs/manual.pdf) shows how to use the program. We also have some [tutorial videos on Medviso's Segment page](http://medviso.com/products/segment/).
 * If you want to develop your own plugins (or if you're just curious), the [tech manual](source/Docs/techmanual.pdf) shows how Segment works internally.

**It is strongly recommended to use Matlab R2014a.**
 * Performance of the GUI will be reduced with newer versions, as a new GUI framework was introduced in R2014b.
 * Using older versions may produce bugs due to non-existent functionality.
 * You can have several Matlab installations on the same computer at the same time.
