   Licensee shall take appropriate action by instruction, agreement, or
   otherwise with any persons permitted access to the Programs, so as to
   enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations under the terms of this 
   Agreement.

6. LICENSES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.  MathWorks has been granted 
   licenses to distribute certain Third Party software.  As a condition
   of those licenses, MathWorks is required to distribute the software 
   to Licensee subject to specific terms and conditions, which may be 
   different from or additional to those contained herein for MathWorks'
   Programs.  Licensee understands and agrees that acceptance of this 
   Agreement also confirms Licensee's acceptance of the applicable 
   provisions for use, including the restrictions on use, of such Third
   Party software.  The current applicable provisions may be viewed at 
   www.mathworks.com/thirdpartylicense.  Licensee may also contact 
   MathWorks to obtain the current applicable provisions.  Licensee's 
   breach of the applicable provisions of any Third Party's license 
   terms shall also be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

7. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICE. During any paid Software Maintenance 
   Service term, if applicable, MathWorks shall provide Software 
   Maintenance Service for the licensed Programs which consists of:  
   delivering subsequent releases of the Programs, if any, that are not
   charged for separately; exerting reasonable efforts to both (a) 
   provide, within a reasonable time, workarounds for any material 
   programming errors in the current release of the Programs that are 
   directly attributable to MathWorks, and (b) correct such errors in 
   the next available release, provided Licensee provides MathWorks with
   sufficient information to identify the errors.  During this same paid
   Software Maintenance Service term, Licensee shall also be entitled to
   receive technical support for the current release.  Technical support
   means assistance by telephone, fax, and electronic mail with the 
   installation and/or use of the then-current release of the licensed 
   Programs, including all available bug fixes and patches, and their 
   interaction with supported hardware and operating systems 
   ("Platforms").  MathWorks reserves the option to discontinue, in 
   whole or in part, and at any time, offering Software Maintenance 
   Service and/or technical support for any Program or Platform.

8. LICENSE DURATION ("TERM").  This Agreement shall continue until the 
   earlier of (a) termination by MathWorks or Licensee as provided 
   below, or (b) such time as there are no Programs being licensed to 
   Licensee hereunder.  

   8.1. For Annual Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each 
        Annual License will expire automatically immediately after its
        corresponding one (1) year period, unless Licensee renews its 
        License by remitting the then-current annual License fee.  
        Licensee understands that the Programs will stop operating 
        unless Licensee pays the License fee and is provided new annual
        passcodes.   Licensee understands and agrees that the Software 
        Maintenance Service for each Annual License will terminate 
        automatically upon expiration of the Annual License Term. 

   8.2. For Term Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each 
        Term License will expire automatically immediately after the 
        corresponding period of the term licensed, unless Licensee 
        renews its License by remitting the then-current term License 
        Fee.  Licensee understands that the Programs will stop operating
        unless Licensee pays the license fee and is provided new term 
        passcodes.  Licensee understands and agrees that the Software 
        Maintenance Service for each Term License will terminate 
        automatically upon expiration of the License Term. 

   8.3. For Perpetual Licenses:  Licensee shall have the right to use 
        the Programs indefinitely, subject to the termination provisions
        in this Agreement.  Licensee understands and agrees that the 
        Software Maintenance Service for each Perpetual License will 
        terminate automatically upon expiration of the initial Software
        Maintenance Service term included with the acquisition of the 
        License.  Thereafter, the Software Maintenance Service term may 
        be renewed for any Program, at the then-current price, and for 
        the then-applicable term, as long as MathWorks offers such 
        Software Maintenance Service for such Program.

   8.4. For Student Licenses:  The Student License term expires 
        automatically immediately after the duration of Licensee's 
        enrollment in a degree-granting institution or participation in 
        a continuing education program of a degree-granting institution.
        Software Maintenance Service is not available for Student 
        Licenses. 

9. TERMINATION.  MathWorks may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses
   granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches
   any material term of this License, including failure to pay any 
   License fees due, and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty
   (60) days of written notification.  MathWorks may immediately 
   terminate upon notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted 
   hereunder should Licensee breach the terms and conditions of Sections
   3, 4, and/or 10.  Licensee may terminate this License at any time, 
   for any reason.  Licensee shall not be entitled to any refund if this
   License is terminated, except for License fees paid for any Programs
   for which the Acceptance Period has not expired at the time of 
   termination.  Upon termination, Licensee shall promptly return all 
   but archival copies of the Programs in Licensee's possession or 
   control, or promptly provide written certification of their 
   destruction.

10. EXPORT CONTROL.  The Programs may be subject to U.S. export control 
    laws or other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import 
    laws and regulations.  Notwithstanding any other term of this 
    Agreement or Third Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this 
    Agreement may not be exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in 
    violation of such laws and regulations, nor may this Agreement be 
    transferred to any party where doing so would result in such a 
    violation.  The terms of any limitation on the use, transfer or 
    re-export of the Programs imposed by MathWorks in any Destination 
    Control Statement or other document for the purpose of export 
    control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement.  It shall be
    Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United States or
    other governmental export and import regulations.

11. FEDERAL ACQUISITION.  This provision applies to all acquisitions of 
    the Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal 
    government of the United States.  By accepting delivery of the 
    Programs or Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this 
    software or documentation qualifies as commercial computer software 
    or commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used
    or defined in FAR 12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014.
    Accordingly, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and only 
    those rights specified in this Agreement, shall pertain to and 
    govern the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, 
    display, and disclosure of the Programs and Documentation by the 
    federal government (or other entity acquiring for or through the 
    federal government) and shall supersede any conflicting contractual 
    terms or conditions.  If this License fails to meet the government's
    needs or is inconsistent in any respect with federal procurement 
    law, the government agrees to return the Programs and Documentation,
    unused, to MathWorks. 

12. FOR EUROPEAN UNION LICENSEES ONLY.  Any contractual provisions of 
    this Agreement contrary to laws implemented under Article 6 of 
    Appendix V of the European Union Software Directive or to the 
    exceptions provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) of such Appendix 
    shall be null and void solely to the extent decompiling, 
    disassembling, or otherwise reverse-engineering of the Programs is 
    necessary to enable the Licensee to create an independent program 
    that is interoperable with the Programs or any other permitted 
    objectives specified by such laws implemented under such directive 
    (collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"), provided that any such 
    information gained is used solely for such Permitted Objectives. 

13. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS.  Absent appropriate exemption certificates
    or other conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay 
    all applicable sales, use, excise, value-added, and other taxes, 
    duties, levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in 
    connection with this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder, 
    excluding taxes based on or measured by MathWorks' income, for which
    MathWorks shall be solely responsible. 

14. ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this 
    Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in 
    part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent 
    of MathWorks.  In the case of any permitted assignment or transfer 
    of or under this Agreement, this Agreement or the relevant 
    provisions shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the 
    successors, executors, heirs, representatives, administrators and 
    assigns of the parties hereto.  MathWorks may charge Licensee an 
    administrative fee for any permitted assignment.

15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  The Programs should not be relied on as 
    the sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose 
    incorrect solution or implementation could result in injury to 
    person or property.  If a Program is employed in such a manner, it 
    is at the Licensee's own risk and MathWorks and its licensors 
    explicitly disclaim all liability for such misuse to the extent 
    allowed by law.  MathWorks' and MathWorks' Licensors' liability for 
    death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any other 
    matter in relation to which liability by law cannot be excluded or 
    limited shall not be excluded or limited.  Except as aforesaid, (a) 
    any other liability of MathWorks and its Licensors (whether in 
    relation to breach of contract, negligence or otherwise) shall not 
    in total exceed the amount paid to MathWorks under this Agreement in
    the twelve month period preceding the claim in question, for the 
    Program with respect to which the liability in question arises; and 
    (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have no liability for any 
    indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and
    including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, 
    and loss of use of any computer hardware or software).  Some states 
    do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or 
    consequential damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not 
    apply to Licensee. 

16. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES.  MathWorks warrants that 
    MathWorks, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right
    to grant the License rights hereunder.  MathWorks warrants that the 
    physical media provided shall be free from defects in material and 
    workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery, or it 
    will be replaced by MathWorks at no cost to Licensee.  MathWorks 
    further warrants, for a period of one (1) year from delivery or for 
    the term of the License, whichever is less, that each copy of each
    Program will conform in all material respects to the description of 
    such Program's operation in the Documentation.  In the event that a 
    Program does not operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy 
    and MathWorks' sole liability under this warranty shall be the 
    correction or workaround by MathWorks of major defects within a 
    reasonable time.  Should such correction or workaround be 
    impractical, MathWorks may, at its option, terminate the relevant 
    License and refund the initial License fee paid to MathWorks for 
    such Program.  All requests for warranty assistance should be 
    directed to The MathWorks, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA 
    01760-2098, U.S.A.

17. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  Except for warranties expressly set forth
    in Section 16 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law 
    provides that the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by 
    contract), any and all Programs, Documentation, and Software 
    Maintenance Services are delivered "as is" and MathWorks makes and 
    the Licensee receives no additional express or implied warranties.  
    MathWorks and its Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and all 
    other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature 
    concerning the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance 
    Services (including, without limitation, any with regard to 
    infringement, merchantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a 
    particular purpose or Licensee's purpose).  MathWorks also expressly
    disclaims any warranties that may be implied from usage of trade, 
    course of dealing, or course of performance.  Except for the express
    warranties stated in Section 16 of this Agreement, the Programs, 
    Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services are provided with 
    all faults, and the entire risk of satisfactory quality, 
    performance, accuracy, and effort is with Licensee.  MathWorks does 
    not warrant that the Programs and Documentation will operate without
    interruption or be error free.  Some states and countries do not 
    allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the 
    above limitation may not apply to Licensee.  The warranty in Section
    16 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee may also have 
    other rights which vary from state to state and country to country. 
    Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs and the 
    results obtained therefrom.

18. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION.  This Agreement shall be interpreted,
    enforced and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder
    governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of
    Massachusetts, United States of America, without regard to its
    conflicts of law provisions, and both parties consent to the
    jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in said
    Commonwealth and consent to the service of process, pleadings and
    notices in connection with any and all actions initiated in such
    courts.  The parties agree that a final judgment in any such action
    or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in
    any other jurisdiction.  To the extent any governing law, treaty, or
    regulation is in conflict with this Agreement, the conflicting terms
    of this Agreement shall be superseded only to the extent necessary
    by such law, treaty, or regulation.  If any provision of this
    Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or otherwise
    unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum
    extent permissible.  In either case, the remainder of this Agreement
    shall not be affected.  The parties agree that the U.N. Convention
    on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to
    this Agreement.  The parties further agree that the Uniform Computer
    Information Transactions Act, or any version thereof, adopted by any
    state, in any form ("UCITA"), shall not apply to this Agreement.  To
    the extent that UCITA is applicable, the parties agree to opt out of
    the applicability of UCITA pursuant to the Opt-Out provision(s)
    contained therein.

19. COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT RIGHTS.  Licensee agrees to notify MathWorks 
    promptly upon discovery of any failure to comply with one or more 
    Licenses granted under this Agreement, or any failure to comply with
    any other material term of this Agreement.  To confirm Licensee's
    compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee
    agrees to allow MathWorks to audit Licensee's use of the Programs,
    and to provide MathWorks access to Licensee's facilities and
    computer systems, and cooperation from Licensee's employees and
    consultants, as reasonably requested by MathWorks in order to
    perform such audit, all during normal business hours, and after
    reasonable prior notice from MathWorks.  If an audit discloses that
    Licensee has failed to comply with one or more Licenses, and such
    failure to comply could have in part or in whole been avoided by
    Licensee having paid additional License fees to expand the scope of
    the License or Licenses, then Licensee shall promptly pay MathWorks
    such Licensing fees (at MathWorks' then current rates) and, if such
    unpaid License fees exceed 5% of the License fees paid to MathWorks
    for the applicable Programs during the applicable period during
    which such underpayment occurred, then Licensee shall, in addition
    to paying the unpaid License fees, also reimburse MathWorks the full
    cost of such audit.

20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, and any applicable Addendum 
    thereto including any documents referenced therein are incorporated 
    herein by reference, and contain the entire understanding of the
    parties and may not be modified or amended except by written
    instrument, executed by authorized representatives of MathWorks and
    Licensee.  In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and
    any purchase order executed by Licensee (whether executed before or
    after this Agreement), this Agreement shall prevail.

4. LICENSE OPTIONS AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING. 

   4.1. Individual.  Except as specifically set forth in Section 4.4 
        hereof, the Individual License Option permits only the 
        Standalone Named User Installation Type.  Program use is 
        restricted to the single, designated Named User.  

   4.2. Group. Except as specifically set forth in Section 4.4 hereof, 
        the Group License Option permits either the Standalone Named 
        User or Network Named User Installation Types.  The Programs may
        be operated by a combined workgroup of Named Users, up to the
        maximum number of Named Users licensed to use each Program.
        Licensee is responsible for ensuring that the total number of
        Named Users of each Program on a License does not exceed the
        number licensed for each Program.  This License Option must be
        centrally administered and maintained.  Licensee shall be
        responsible for, and shall assign a central administrator the
        task of, accurately counting and controlling the number of Named
        Users allowed access to each Program, and installing and
        administering the Programs including new versions of the
        Programs delivered during any paid Software Maintenance Service
        term.  

   4.3. Concurrent.  Except as specifically set forth in Section 4.4 
        hereof, the Concurrent License Option permits only the Network 
        Concurrent User Installation Type.

   4.4. Distributed Computing.  The Individual, Group, and Concurrent 
        License Options permit Licensees who also license both the 
        MATLAB Distributed Computing Engine ("Engine") and the 
        Distributed Computing Toolbox to install Programs, other than
        any Ineligible Program, in a central location on a single
        designated computer or on different computer nodes within a
        cluster of computers for the principal purpose of making
        available Programs sessions in a distributed computing
        environment provided that (1) the computer or computer cluster
        is controlled by a single license manager for each Engine, (2)
        the number of Program sessions operating at any one time is
        limited to the number of Engine workers acquired, (3) access to
        any Program, including the Engine, is not made available (i) to
        any Third Party without the advance written consent of
        MathWorks, or (ii) to any user outside the country in which the
        Engine's license manager server is installed, unless the
        Licensee acquires a separate license from MathWorks; and (4)
        access to any Program, whether in the Engine or otherwise,
        remains limited to those persons who are Licensed Users of such
        Programs, and the Distributed Computing Toolbox.  For the
        purposes of this Section 4.4, all Engine license manager servers
        located in a member country of the North American Free Trade
        Agreement ("NAFTA") shall be considered located in the same
        country as those of the other NAFTA members, and all Engine
        license manager servers located in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland,
        or any member country of the European Union ("EU") shall be
        considered located in the same country.   

5. INSTALLATION TYPES.

   5.1. Standalone Named User.  Programs may only be installed and 
        operated on one or more individual, standalone computers,
        provided the Programs are only accessible to, and operated by,
        the Named User(s) for that License.  Network installation is
        prohibited.  The locations of the standalone computers used by
        the Named User to run the Programs are not limited; the
        computers may be located at work, home, in a laboratory, or on a
        laptop.  Licensee may only designate one Licensed User access to
        or use of the Programs under each Named User License.  Licensee
        may replace the Named User for a Program, whether temporarily or
        not, no more than four (4) times per year.  A Named User may run
        multiple simultaneous Program sessions on not more than two (2)
        separate processors, whether located in the same or different
        computers, without acquiring a written license to do so.   

        Alternatively, for the Windows platform only, Licensee may
        install the Programs on a single, designated, standalone
        computer, provided the Programs are only operated from that
        computer's console by only one individual at any given time (a
        "Designated Computer" Installation Type).  This Designated
        Computer Installation Type is in lieu of the Standalone Named
        User rights above, not in addition to those rights, and is
        intended to accommodate a single Windows computer shared by
        multiple users.  

   5.2. Network Named User.  Programs may only be installed in a central
        location on a single designated network server.  Licensee must
        run the FLEXlm license manager software provided with the
        Program in its User-Based mode, and edit the Local License
        Options file to maintain a list of Named Users authorized to
        access and operate each Program.  Licensee may re-edit the list
        of Named Users in the Local License Options file and may replace
        Named Users for a Program, whether temporarily or not, no more
        than four (4) times per year, provided the number of Named Users
        in the file never exceeds the number licensed per Program.
        Portions of the Programs may be installed on individual
        computers to accelerate startup times, as long as the
        installations on the individual computers are controlled by the
        license manager on the network server.  A Named User may run
        multiple simultaneous Program sessions on not more than two (2)
        separate processors, whether located in the same or different
        computers, without acquiring a written license to do so.    

   5.3. Network Concurrent User.  The Programs may only be installed in
        a central location on a single designated network server.
        Licensee may have only as many Licensed Users simultaneously
        operating a Program at any given time as the number of
        Concurrent keys acquired for that Program, except in the case of
        the Engine in which case the number of Program sessions running
        at any one time is limited to the number of Engine workers
        acquired.  Portions of the Programs may be installed on
        individual computers to accelerate startup times, as long as the
        installations on the individual computers are controlled by the
        license manager on the network server.  Subject to the
        foregoing, a Licensed User of the Concurrent License Option may
        utilize any number of computers served by a single license
        manager server provided that, before starting a Program session
        on any computer, the Licensed User checks out a Concurrent key
        from the license manager server for that computer, and that any
        Concurrent Program sessions on each computer are not run on more
        than two (2) separate processors on each computer.   Licensees
        of the Concurrent License Option are prohibited from providing
        Program access to users located outside the country in which the
        license manager server is installed unless Licensee has
        contracted for global use.  For the purposes of the Concurrent
        License Option, all servers located in a member country of the
        North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") shall be
        considered located in the same country as those of the other
        NAFTA members, and all servers located in Iceland, Norway,
        Switzerland, or any member country of the European Union ("EU")
        shall be considered located in the same country.

This is an Addendum to The MathWorks, Inc. Software License Agreement
(the "Agreement"), and the terms and conditions of this Addendum are
incorporated therein.  Each capitalized term used herein and not defined
herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Agreement. 

1. PURPOSE.  The MathWorks, Inc. Software License Agreement (the 
   "Agreement") contains restrictions prohibiting Licensee from
   modifying, distributing, or providing access to the Programs or any
   Program Components, except as expressly provided in this Addendum.
   If the Programs licensed by Licensee under the Agreement contain
   Source Code or Object Code Program Components, then this Addendum
   sets forth the Licensee's rights with respect to creating
   Applications and Derivative Forms and distributing Applications,
   Derivative Forms, and Deployment Programs, as well as certain
   additional obligations related thereto.  

   MathWorks or its Licensors retain all right, title, and interest in
   its Programs, Program Components, and Derivative Forms of its
   Programs.

2. USER CREATED FILES.  This Addendum does not apply to M-files, 
   MDL-files, MEX-files, MAT-files, FIG-files and P-files that are
   created by Licensee and that do not include any code obtained from
   M-files, MAT-files, P-code, MDL-files, C/C++ files, TLC-files, or
   other Source Code files supplied with the Programs ("User Files").
   Licensee may distribute, sublicense, and resell without restriction,
   User Files.  

3. NONCOMPETITION.  Licensee agrees not to use the Programs, Derivative 
   Forms, Generated Forms, or Program Components to make or distribute 
   its own or a Third Party's Application, a principal purpose of which, 
   as reasonably determined by MathWorks, is to perform the same or 
   similar functions as Programs licensed by MathWorks or which replaces
   any component of the Programs.  Licensee shall not otherwise use the
   Programs to compete with the products or businesses of MathWorks,
   including by distributing Libraries, or any form of an entire Program
   or a substantial portion of a Program. 

4. DEFINITIONS.

   4.1. Application.  A software file that Licensee has created by 
        either (a) using a MathWorks Program to compile or translate
        Licensee created Source Code or (b) incorporating or linking any
        part of any Source Code, library file, or other Program
        Component provided with the Program.  An Application must
        contain original code developed by Licensee and must provide
        substantial functionality not contained in, or provided by, the
        Program Components that are incorporated into such Application.
        If a software file created by a Licensee incorporates Program
        Components, but does not meet the requirements of the previous
        sentence, then it is a Derivative Form (as defined below).  An
        Application may contain Linked Object Code which, if such Object
        Code was not Linked to the Application and was a standalone
        file, would otherwise have been deemed a Derivative Form. 

   4.2. Application License.  A license granted by Licensee to its 
        end-users for the installation and use of Licensee's
        Application.

   4.3. Generated Forms.  The output of the MATLAB Compiler, Real-Time 
        Workshop, Stateflow Coder, Embedded Coders, and other MathWorks'
        code generation Programs in the form of Source Code, as well as
        such Source Code converted to Object Code or Linked forms.

   4.4. Derivative Forms.  A  software file that Licensee has derived 
        from one or more Program Components (including without
        limitation by incorporating, translating, or modifying, in whole
        or in part, any Program Component), and which, if modified or
        copied without MathWorks' authorization, would constitute a
        copyright infringement or breach of the Agreement.  A software
        file created by Licensee which qualifies as an "Application"
        under the above definition shall not be deemed a Derivative
        Form.

   4.5. Linked.   An executable or loadable file created by a compiler 
        or linker program combining Object Code module files.

   4.6. MAT-file.  The file format in which MATLAB stores data.

   4.7. MCR Libraries.  MATLAB Component Runtime support libraries and 
        other files for deployment of Applications created with the
        MATLAB Compiler.

   4.8. Object Code.  The code created by a system compiler from source 
        code; also called "machine-readable code".  Object Code can be
        Linked with an appropriate linker to resolve address references
        and may be combined with other Object Code for targeted
        execution on a specific processor.  Object Code includes "Object
        Code libraries" and "shared libraries," which are groupings of
        Object Code for specific purposes.

   4.9. Program Component.  Any portion of, or file provided with, a 
        Program.

   4.10. Source Code.  Human-readable program code written in a 
         higher-level language such as C, C++, Java, MATLAB,
         MDL-files, VHDL, or Fortran, which must be translated or
         compiled into machine-readable language before it can be
         executed by a computer.  Source Code also includes header files
         and other human-readable files necessary for a Program to be
         compiled in the higher-level language.

   4.11. Standalone Application.  An Application created using 
         programming languages and tools other than the Programs, which
         executes outside of the Programs.

   4.12. Deployment Program.  Any MathWorks Program that either (a) 
         generates Object Code or Source Code in response to user input,
         or (b) contains executable functions or data accessed by an
         Application (such as a DLL file).

5. DEPLOYMENT PROGRAMS.  Licensed Users of MathWorks' Deployment 
   Programs may automatically generate code from M-files,
   Simulink/Stateflow diagrams, and other representations, into
   Generated Forms.  Furthermore, Licensee may copy and deploy these
   Generated Forms for use outside of the Programs.

   Not all Programs are eligible for deployment within Licensee's
   Application.  For a list of those Programs that are ineligible for
   deployment, compilation, distribution, distributed computing, or web
   access see www.mathworks.com/ineligible_programs.  

   5.1. MATLAB Application Deployment Programs

      5.1.1. MATLAB Compiler. Licensee may use and distribute the MCR 
             Libraries for the sole purpose of running Licensed User's
             Application generated by the MATLAB Compiler.  Licensee may
             deploy, at no cost, copies of such Applications that
             incorporate the MCR Libraries and compiled versions of
             M-files from the licensed Programs required for the
             Application.  No further fees shall be due to MathWorks for
             such deployment within Licensee's Application, regardless
             of whether the Application is distributed solely for
             Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third Parties. 

         5.1.1.1. Licensed User may include, by compilation for deployment,
                  only those select M-files from the licensed Programs
                  required for the Application.  

         5.1.1.2. In no event shall Licensee distribute any library 
                  header files.

         5.1.1.3. Licensee's Application may not provide functionality or 
                  behavior similar to that of the MATLAB command line.

         5.1.1.4. Licensee's Application may not allow operation of the
                  code generation capabilities of Programs.

         5.1.1.5. Licensee's Application may not provide access to an 
                  entire Program or a substantial portion of a Program. 

         5.1.1.6. Licensee shall include the notice "MATLAB. 1984 -
                  [INSERT YEAR MATLAB VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks,
                  Inc." in the deployed Application's About Box, or
                  similar visible location, and in the applicable
                  documentation distributed with each copy of the
                  Application. 

         5.1.1.7. Licensee must state in the documentation or other 
                  materials distributed with the Application that
                  Licensee's limited rights to the deployment are
                  governed by a certain license agreement between
                  Licensee and MathWorks. Licensee may not modify or
                  remove any license agreement file (MathWorks or
                  Third-Party) that is included with the MCR Libraries
                  ("MCR Library License").  Licensee shall insure that
                  any licensee of the Application must first accept the
                  terms of such MCR Library License prior to
                  installation of the Application.

   5.2. Simulink Application Deployment Programs 

      5.2.1. Deployment Programs.  MathWorks provides directories of C, 
             C++, linker command files, template makefiles, project
             files, and TLC source code files with Programs that
             implement the real-time framework, code generation
             instructions, libraries, and Application Programming
             Interface (API) for use with the code generated by the
             Simulink family of products, including Real-Time Workshop,
             Stateflow Coder, Embedded Coders and other Programs.
             Licensee may use, copy, and modify these files in source
             code form for different development targets provided that
             they are only copied for development use in connection with
             Real-Time Workshop, Embedded Coders, Stateflow Coder, or
             other code generation Programs.

         5.2.1.1. Licensee may copy and deploy these files outside of 
                  the Programs in Linked Object Code form or Source Code
                  form, if used in combination with code generated by
                  those Programs as part of a larger standalone
                  Application. 

         5.2.1.2. No further fees shall be due to MathWorks for such 
                  deployment within Licensee's Application, regardless
                  of whether the Application is deployed solely for
                  Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third Parties.

      5.2.2. Real-Time Windows Target.  Licensee may not incorporate 
             Real-Time Windows Target into an Application for deployment
             without contracting with MathWorks for an OEM or VAR
             agreement. 

      5.2.3. xPC Target.  Licensee may develop Applications that 
             incorporate Linked-in copies of xPC Target and those files
             required for the Application that have been compiled or
             otherwise obtained from Real-Time Workshop and/or Stateflow
             Coder on a single development PC, and download that
             Application to a target PC directly connected to the
             development PC by either Ethernet or serial connections.
             When running on xPC TargetBox, the Application may also
             be used for standalone operation, without connection to the
             development PC.  

         5.2.3.1. The right to distribute the Application beyond the 
                  target PC is contingent upon acquiring a License for
                  the xPC Target Embedded Option.  No further fees shall
                  be due to MathWorks for such deployment within
                  Licensee's Application, regardless of whether the
                  Application is deployed solely for Licensee's Internal
                  Operations or to Third Parties. Additionally, the
                  Embedded Option License allows for the deployment of
                  API DLL's beyond the development PC.  No further fees
                  shall be due to MathWorks for such deployment outside
                  of an Application, regardless of whether the API DLL's
                  are deployed solely for Licensee's Internal Operations
                  or to Third Parties.  

6. OTHER SOURCE CODE AND SHARED OBJECT CODE LIBRARIES. 

   6.1. Programs may include selected Source Code and shared Object Code
        library files that implement various documented application
        programming interface capabilities of the Programs for which the
        Source Code or shared library file is part. 

      6.1.1. Licensed User may use and modify the selected Source Code 
             files solely for creation of Licensee's own Applications.
             Licensee may copy and distribute Object Code compiled from
             this Source Code, but only as either standalone Object Code
             file (regardless whether a Derivative Form) or Object Code
             Linked to the Application, and only for use with and
             deployment of Licensee's own Application. 

      6.1.2. Licensee may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code 
             library files (regardless whether a Derivative Form) for
             deployment of Licensee's own Application, but only if a
             header file exists in the Program for the shared library
             file. Licensee may not copy or distribute header files
             themselves.

      6.1.3. Licensee may not transfer Source Code, development rights, 
             or development capabilities for any Source Code or Object
             Code to any Third Party.

   6.2. MAT-files.  Licensed User may create and distribute Applications
        that read MAT-files using the MAT-file API, however, if such
        Applications are distributed to Third Parties, they must also
        implement MAT-file write capability.

7. DERIVATIVE FORMS.  A Licensee shall only be permitted to distribute a
   Derivative Form to Third Parties (a) to the extent expressly
   permitted under Sections 5 or 6 of this Addendum, or (b) subject to
   the requirements of this Section 7.  A Licensee may only distribute a
   Derivative Form to a Third Party under this Section 7 if such Third
   Party is bound by a Software License Agreement with MathWorks that
   requires such Third Party to treat such Derivative Forms received
   from Licensee as such Third Party's own Derivative Form thereunder.
   Licensee agrees that if such a Third Party provides Licensee with
   software that is a Derivative Form under the terms of such Third
   Party's Software License Agreement with MathWorks (or would otherwise
   be a Derivative Form under the terms of this Agreement), then
   Licensee shall treat such software as a Derivative Form hereunder as
   if Licensee has modified or generated the software itself.

8. WEB ACCESS.

   8.1. The licensed Programs may not be operated from within a Web 
        Application without acquiring a MATLAB Web Server License.

   8.2. MATLAB Web Server.  A Licensed User of the MATLAB Web Server may
        call the licensed Programs from within their own external Web
        standalone Application, provided the Licensed User's Web
        standalone Application does not provide access to the MATLAB
        command line, or any of the licensed Programs with code
        generation capabilities.  In addition, Licensed Users may not
        provide access to an entire Program or a substantial portion of
        a Program.  Such operation of a standalone Application via a Web
        interface may be provided to an unlimited number of web browser
        clients, at no cost, for Licensee's own use for its Internal
        Operations, and for use by Third Parties. 

9. APPLICATION LICENSING.  For any distribution of Applications 
   containing Object Code or Generated Forms to:

   9.1. Licensee's internal organization:  Licensee shall take 
        appropriate action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise with
        any recipients of the Application, so as to enable Licensee to
        satisfy its obligations under the terms of this Addendum and the
        Agreement.

   9.2. Third Parties:  Your Application shall be accompanied by an 
        Application License whose terms and conditions are at least as
        restrictive as the Agreement, unless the Application is part of
        an embedded system that has no provision for licensing to its
        end users. 

      9.2.1. The Application license for Third Parties must explicitly 
             exclude MathWorks and its Licensors from all liability for 
             damages or any obligation to provide remedial actions.
      9.2.2. In no circumstance shall Licensee include a warranty for 
             any form of a Program that is inconsistent with or 
             additional to the warranty contained in the Agreement.  
      9.2.3. The additional translation, use, and deployment rights 
             granted in this Addendum are nontransferable without 
             MathWorks' consent and shall not be conveyed in Licensee's
             Application license. 
      9.2.4. All copyright and proprietary notices for the Programs that
             appear in the original form delivered to Licensee shall be 
             duplicated and included with Licensee's own copyright 
             notices for the Application, wherever they appear.
      9.2.5. Licensee may not remove any copyright, trademark, logo, 
             proprietary rights, disclaimer or warning notice included 
             on or embedded in any part of the deployed Application.

   9.3. Notwithstanding the termination of the Agreement, all valid 
        Application licenses shall remain and continue in full force and
        effect, and, if the Agreement was not terminated due to:  (a)
        Licensee's failure to pay the applicable fees to MathWorks, (b)
        Licensee's violation of the License restrictions, or (c)
        violation of MathWorks' proprietary rights in the Programs; then
        Licensee may continue to use the Programs to support
        Applications that have been placed in use pursuant to an
        Application License prior to the effective date of termination.

10. DISCLAIMER OF OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY,

   10.1. MathWorks shall have no support or warranty obligations, and 
         disclaims all liability, for Applications developed or
         distributed by Licensee.

   10.2. Licensee agrees that prior to using, incorporating, or 
         distributing the Programs in any Application, it will
         thoroughly test and validate the Application and the
         functionality of the Programs in that Application and be solely
         responsible for any problems or failures.

   10.3. Licensee will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MathWorks 
         and its Licensors, officers, directors, employees, agents and
         resellers from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and
         expenses (including reasonable fees of MathWorks' attorneys)
         arising out of any Third Party claim or demand based on or
         arising from, out of or in connection with (i) the creation,
         use, or distribution of any Applications or (ii) the use of the
         Programs by Licensee.

11. GENERAL.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that a breach of the
    obligations set forth in this Addendum shall be a material breach of
    the Agreement.
